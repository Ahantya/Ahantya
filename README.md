[TuneUp](https://github.com/Ahantya/TuneUp) - An application (in C++ and Python) that recommends music to others through a K-Clustering Algorithm based on multiple features after retrieving the data of the user's public playlists on Spotify. (Created along with 3 others who are in repo)

[Microsoft Rewards Updater](https://github.com/Ahantya/Microsoft-Rewards-Updater) - An application (in Python) that allows for a user to input their data on their Microsoft Rewards Points into a new file, and updates their data in a file while allowing to pick on a variety of features, such as their average earnings per day, as well as the time until their inputted goal will be reached based on their past analytics.

[The Spotless Sweepers](https://github.com/Ahantya/ahantya.github.io) - A website (in HTML/CSS) originally made for FBLA 2023's Competition, which focused on a local business that helped out its community. The website earned a State Finalist Award.

[Python Task Manager](https://github.com/Ahantya/Task_Manager_Python) - A Python Application that allows you to create tasks with a due date and priority, including a status of the task. Currently, it saves the tasks into a txt file that can be accessed after the program runs. The 5 main options in the program as of now are add task, delete task, view tasks, complete task, and exit program. This is a relatively new app, so I will be adding more as I go. 

[Velo](coming soon) - An app (in Python?) that will allow a student to help organize their schoolwork, give reminders on upcoming assignments, check courses to choose from the upcoming year, and more. 

[Complex KanBan](https://github.com/Ahantya/complexkanban-Ahantya) - A C++ Library created from Scratch that can be used for complex numbers with over 30 ish methods and objects, organized in multiple files with comments. Note: I created this for a school project with 3 other people, 2 of 3 which also helped create TuneUp.
