[TuneUp](https://github.com/Ahantya/TuneUp) - An application (in C++ and Python) that recommends music to others through a K-Clustering Algorithm based on multiple features after retrieving the data of the user's public playlists on Spotify. (Created along with 3 others who are in repo)

[Microsoft Rewards Updater](https://github.com/Ahantya/Microsoft-Rewards-Updater) - An application (in Python) that allows for a user to input their data on their Microsoft Rewards Points into a new file, and updates their data in a file while allowing to pick on a variety of features, such as their average earnings per day, as well as the time until their inputted goal will be reached based on their past analytics.

[The Spotless Sweepers](https://github.com/Ahantya/ahantya.github.io) - A website (in HTML/CSS) originally made for FBLA 2023's Competition, which focused on a local business that helped out its community. The website earned a State Finalist Award.

[WeatherApp](https://github.com/Ahantya/WeatherApp) - A basic weather app that is created in Xcode and SwitfUI (for me to learn more of Swift before I create an a heavier-load app)

[Velo](coming soon) - An app (in SwiftUI and Xcode) that will allow a student to help organize their schoolwork, give reminders on upcoming assignments, check courses to choose from the upcoming year, and more.
