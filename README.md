[TuneUp](https://github.com/Ahantya/TuneUp) - An application (in C++ and Python) that recommends music to others through a K-Clustering Algorithm based on multiple features after retrieving the data of the user's public playlists on Spotify. (Created along with 3 others)

[The Spotless Sweepers](https://github.com/Ahantya/ahantya.github.io) - A website (in HTML/CSS) originally made for FBLA 2023's Website Design Competition, which focused on creating a website for a local business that helped out its community. The website earned a State Finalist Award and 1st in Regionals.

[Complex KanBan](https://github.com/Ahantya/complexkanban-Ahantya) - A C++ Library created from Scratch that can be used for complex numbers with over 30 ish methods and objects, organized in multiple files with comments. Note: I created this for a school project with 3 other people, 2 of 3 which also helped create TuneUp. 

[Business Partner Database](https://github.com/Ahantya/Coding-Programming) - A Python Program that generates a mongo database with PyQt5 UI and SQLite3 backend support, allowing for an admin and student look through business partners within the Career and Technical Department of a Hypothethical School. The admin log in allows users to add, delete (specific or all partners), edit, and search parters while the student log in allows users to only search partners. Both users can log out or exit the app. (This was done for FBLA 2024 for Coding and Programming and has earned 1st in Regionals so far). (Created along with 2 others)

[Data Scrapers](https://github.com/Ahantya/DataScraperScripts) - A compilation of Python Programs that scrape data from different websites, such as YouTube, ProFootballReference, League Of Legends, and Reddit. praw is the Python library that is used to connect the program to Reddit while googleapiclient and Google Cloud Console with the json library is needed to connect the program to YoutTube. ProFootballReference info is pulled through pandas library, and analyzed through imported matplotlib charts/graphs. League of Legends info is pulled through Riot's official API and requires specific methods only within API. As of now, it only pulls the last 20 champions you played.

[Microsoft Rewards Updater](https://github.com/Ahantya/Microsoft-Rewards-Updater) - An application (in Python) that allows for a user to input their data on their Microsoft Rewards Points into a new file, and updates their data in a file while allowing to pick on a variety of features, such as their average earnings per day, as well as the time until their inputted goal will be reached based on their past analytics.

[Python Task Manager](https://github.com/Ahantya/Task_Manager_Python) - A Python Application that allows you to create tasks with a due date and priority, including a status of the task. Currently, it saves the tasks into a txt file that can be accessed after the program runs. The 5 main options in the program as of now are add task, delete task, view tasks, complete task, and exit program. This is a relatively new app, so I will be adding more as I go.
