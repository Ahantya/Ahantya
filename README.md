[TuneUp](https://github.com/Ahantya/TuneUp) - An application (in C++ and Python) that recommends music to others through a K-Clustering Algorithm based on multiple features after retrieving the data of the user's public playlists on Spotify. (Created along with 3 others who are in repo)

[Microsoft Rewards Updater](https://github.com/Ahantya/Microsoft-Rewards-Updater) - An application (in Python) that allows for a user to input their data on their Microsoft Rewards Points into a new file, and updates their data in a file while allowing to pick on a variety of features, such as their average earnings per day, as well as the time until their inputted goal will be reached based on their past analytics.

[The Spotless Sweepers](https://github.com/Ahantya/ahantya.github.io) - A website (in HTML/CSS) originally made for FBLA 2023's Competition, which focused on a local business that helped out its community. The website earned a State Finalist Award.

[Python Task Manager](https://github.com/Ahantya/Task_Manager_Python) - A Python Application that allows you to create tasks with a due date and priority, including a status of the task. Currently, it saves the tasks into a txt file that can be accessed after the program runs. The 5 main options in the program as of now are add task, delete task, view tasks, complete task, and exit program. This is a relatively new app, so I will be adding more as I go. 

[Reddit Data Scraper](https://github.com/Ahantya/RedditDataScraper) - A Python Program that allows a user to input which subreddit to pull data from, and how many posts they want. It also downloads any images or gifs from the post onto the computer in a folder named images. Currently, the setting is on hot posts from the subreddit, but it can be changed through a tweak in the code. praw is the Python library that is used to connect the program to Python.

COMING SOON.
